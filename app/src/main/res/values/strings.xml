    <string name="old_well_info">The university’s signature structure is not an academic building but a small neoclassical structure placed over a well between Old East and Old West and in front of South Building. University president Edwin Alderman added the domed Old Well in 1897 as part of a campus beautification effort. He found the well’s original wooden cover shabby and ordered it replaced with a rotunda modeled in part after the Temple of Love at Versailles.</string>
