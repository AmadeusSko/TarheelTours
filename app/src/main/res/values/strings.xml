    <string name="old_well_info">The university’s signature structure is not an academic building but a small neoclassical structure placed over a well between Old East and Old West and in front of South Building. University president Edwin Alderman added the domed Old Well in 1897 as part of a campus beautification effort. He found the well’s original wooden cover shabby and ordered it replaced with a rotunda modeled in part after the Temple of Love at Versailles. Rumor has it that drinking from the Old Well before class on the first day of classes will guarantee you a 4.0 GPA during your time at UNC - though this rumor doesn\'t seem to have much in the ways of backing up evidence.</string>
